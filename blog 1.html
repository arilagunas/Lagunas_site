<h1>NOW is the time we UNITE for Social and Environmental JUSTICE
	</h>
 <br>
 <br>
<p> In a world filled with darkness, do not turn your back on the light. We are at a critical turning point in history where our future depends on social justice and environmental reform. Everything in this world is connected, and there is a profound linkage between humans and the Earth from both a local and global scale. The assumption many people have that the Earth is separate from us and thus exploitable is parallel to the assumption that certain people are different and inherently disposable—thus, we cannot truly protect the environment unless we tackle social justice issues as well.
 <br>
 <br>
As we walk in the shadows today of social and environmental injustices, remember to turn to the light and remember that the darker the shadow, the brighter the light. On the horizon shines a future so bright where once again we will celebrate what it means to live full of purpose, connection, and abundance. Although we are in the midst of the most daunting challenges of our time, we--you, me, and everyone—have the power to decide how to show up for it. Are we able to show up for our cause passionately? Are we able to fight for justice peacefully? Are we able to stand with our community courageously? It is in this choice that we define our future together. 
 <br>
 <br>
This is not the time to despair, fear, or retreat, for often, it is these difficult moments that become the foundation of our most vital growth. Rather, this is the time to rise again, embrace new possibilities, heal past traumas, and begin to rebuild.  NOW is time that we UNITE with one single VOICE to stand in DEFENSE of all beings who have suffered ...putting an END to the senseless DESTRUCTION, replacing APATHY with EMPATHY, and creating a global MOVEMENT towards TRANSFORMATION and PROSPERITY. Apart we survive, but together we thrive. And in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds, it is our very belief in the resilience of our ourselves, our brothers and sisters, our global community, and all species, that will define the future of life on Earth. We can and must embody the very light we are seeking, we must be the love we are calling in, and we must be the change we are hoping for. To all experiencing injustices, we see you, we hear you, and we will continue to stand with you!
