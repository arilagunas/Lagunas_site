<h1> Why Chinese wet markets should not be banned
 	</h>
 <br>
 <br>	
<p>
Soon after daybreak, street vendors fill the streets of Tlaltenango, Mexico with stands of fruits, vegetables, meats, and other perishable goods. People from neighboring towns start to flow in, including me and my family who traveled thirty minutes by car from our ranch. I gaze at the various fruits and veggies that line the streets with color, my favorites being mangos, cucumbers, watermelon, and corn. The mood is lively and cheerful, and I feel a deep sense of comfort and familiarity, having visited here many times in my childhood. 
 <br>
 <br>
This food market happens every Sunday and it is what keeps the town bustling with life. Aside from selling essential goods, the market is also integral to Mexican people’s culture and social lives. People come not only to shop, but also to catch up with neighbors and friends while bargaining with vendors about the freshness and price of each good. 
 <br>
 <br>
Contrary to worldwide popular beliefs, the people of China would describe a typical wet market in the exact same way. There is no denying that some existing Chinese markets sell exotic animals, which is problematic as deadly diseases such as the coronavirus can emerge. However, the majority of wet markets do not sell wild animals at all, nor do people typically consume them. 
 <br>
 <br>
The Chinese government permitting the reopening of wet markets has led to criticism from countries all around the world with experts, conservationists, and world leaders demanding China to ban them altogether. Tackling the root of the problem instead however is a lot more feasible, which solely calls for the banning of exotic animals for human consumption and non-evidence based traditional medicines.
 <br>
 <br>
When demanding a country to implement change, the nuances which have existed in their culture for thousands of years must be considered with respect. The use of wild animals in Chinese culture has existed for over 2,000 years, and while it is evident that this practice is far too risky to continue, the traditional wet market does not have to be banned completely. Not everyone has to sacrifice their culture for the Western-style grocery store, but they must adopt better safety precautions for the sake of the rest of the world’s health. 
 <br>
 <br>
On April 30th, Beijing, China banned the consumption of wild animals to reduce the risk of future pandemics. This was a critical first step in the right direction, but the rest of China and countries with similar practices must adopt this legislation as well to globally end the commercial trade of wildlife. As well said by Mahatma Gandhi, “The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated.”  It is catastrophic times like these when a nation truly starts to recognize the great linkage between the health of humans, wild animals, and the planet, a connection that has been long lost in decades past. With that, I am confident that we will come back from this pandemic more resilient and with the recognition that a healthy natural world is critical for a stable and prosperous future.
