<h1> The Great Barrier Reef in the year 2050
 	</h>
 <br>
 <br>
<p>
Wind whips in my hair, salt sticks to my skin, and the sun’s rays blind my eyes as I sail through turquois-blue vastness towards the Great Barrier Reef. I dreamt about this moment ever since Finding Nemo came out in 2003 and I wanted to be the one scuba diving and taking underwater photos. Now it’s 2019 and this dream is finally the reality I am experiencing. 
 <br>
 <br>
The boat approaches the reef and me and my dive buddies Greg and Elise set out. The ecosystem is like a city during rush hour with beautiful creatures like sharks, cuddle fish, and turtles in every direction I turn my head. The experience is truly meditative and serene, and although I am left in awe, I can’t help but also be half disappointed. Despite the place teeming with life, it is the corals that concern me. The reef is like a bleak graveyard, with the bleached and algae-covered coral frameworks resembling cobwebs on tombstones. The excessive bleaching and coral diseases are indicators that the ecosystem is in poor condition. 
<br>
 <br>
I cannot help but imagine the future fate of the Great Barrier Reef. What would it look like when I dive here again in 2050? Will this ecosystem be around for future generations to appreciate? And if the future isn’t bright, how will that impact the wellbeing of humanity? Two possible scenarios arise in my head.
 <br>
 <br>
THE PESSIMISTIC SCENARIO
 <br>
 <br>
By the time I visit here again in 2050, although the ocean’s surface will look the same, it is the hidden glory beneath which will disappear. Following 2020’s Australian bush fires, mass coral bleaching events, and the coronavirus, the world will return to “business as usual”.  Society will continue to fish unsustainably, release excessive carbon into the atmosphere, pollute the water, deep-sea drill, and exploit the planet’s natural resources. Widespread ignorance about the ocean and its vital importance will prevail and thus people will continue to support big businesses and politicians who are driven by commercialism and self-interest.  As a result, more than 90% of the coral reefs will disappear and nearly all biodiversity will be lost, causing the planet to officially hit its 6th mass extinction. Millions of people will lose their most significant food source, storms along coastlines will be more violent, and economies will take a major hit. 
<br>
 <br>
My children’s generation will be the first to lose their relationship with the underwater world which has endured for millenniums. They will visit this reef only to be left disappointed. Gray piles of rubble will be all that remains of the once vibrant and life teeming reef and they will be lucky if they witness even one beautiful creature. At this point, it won’t be long before the magic of life will stop persisting on our planet, including our own species, as marine biodiversity is key to the planet’s food and oxygen production, storm protection, and our economy. 
<br>
 <br>
THE OPTIMISTIC SCENARIO
 <br>
 <br>
After Mother Nature’s persistent wake-up calls, society will finally take the action and initiative to build a better planet and follow a new economic model. The public’s desire for change will never be higher with the realization that we are a part of nature, not in opposition to it, and by protecting nature, we protect ourselves. Thus, will be born the Green Revolution of the 21st century where people collectively will come together to radically transform their lifestyles and behaviors. With that, society will only vote for leaders and supports businesses that are in alignment with this same vision. By doing so, the 6th mass extinction will be prevented, five times as many jobs will be created in the transition to renewable energy, coal companies will go bankrupt, the reefs will be restored with genetic engineering technologies, Marine Protected Areas will increase around the globe, less carbon will be emitted into the atmosphere, more pollution laws for air and water will be passed, fishing will be replaced with ecotourism, and scientists will receive the money and support they need to drive this change. 
As a result, when I visit here again in 2050, the reef will be bustling with life. The reef may even be more vibrant than that of which I witnessed in 2019. Tourists, coastline communities, and society as a whole will be grateful that my generation took the initiative to make this all possible. 
 <br>
 <br>
FINAL WORDS
 <br>
 <br>
After witnessing first-hand the impact of climatic events on the coral reefs, I gained a deep sense of urgency to dedicate my life’s work towards the optimistic scenario. Although I know the situation is not my fault nor my generation’s, it is our responsibility to evolve as a species and implement solutions for more sustainable ways of living. The good news is that change can happen sooner than most people realize, and we already have the knowledge and technology to bring forth this vital transformation. Yes, big business leaders and politicians determine humanity’s fate, but we also play a role. We choose to eat more, to consume more, to live unmindfully, and to abide by the outdated systems that brought us to this point. However, we are not out of the game yet and by taking action now we can turn our fate around. We cannot undo what we have done, we cannot go back in time, but we can choose where we go from here. 
 <br>
 <br>
Let us choose to be present now and to no longer look back on the past with regret, or towards the future with desire, as regret breeds depression and desire breeds anxiety. Instead, let us fully immerse in the present with open hearts and conscious minds, receiving wisdom from the past with gratitude, and opportunities of the future with deep intention. Now is the time to make our voices heard and to take a stand to put an end to the unconscionable practices which are the origin of this global crisis.
